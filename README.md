# Sokoban
A 2D game I implemented in C++ using SDL2.

## The Concept
The aim of the game is to get all boxes on the marked spots. The player can achieve that by pushing the boxes. 
The bonus feature is that by clicking on a certain spot, an animation of the player moving to it will be displayed.
I have created a parser for the levels, so that you can load any level from a .txt file. You can learn more about the level format [here](http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format).
